      # or both. Use 'javascript-typescript' to analyze code written in
      # JavaScript, TypeScript or both. To learn more about changing the
      # languages that are analyzed or customizing the build mode for your
      # analysis.[^1] If you are analyzing a compiled language, you can modify
      # the 'build-mode' for that language to customize how your codebase is
      # analyzed.[^2]
