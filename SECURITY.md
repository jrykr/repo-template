# Security

This repository follows core practices from NIST SP 800-218 (SSDF v1.1) to
reduce software vulnerability risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email: ❌ (TODO) <security@example.com>

- Affected component & version (commit SHA if applicable)
- Steps to reproduce (or proof-of-concept)
- Impact assessment and suggested mitigation (if known)
- Contact info for follow up

We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days, and share an estimated
remediation plan where appropriate. (If you need coordinated disclosure, state
your preferred embargo and contact method.)

Safe harbor and acknowledgement: We will not pursue legal action against
good-faith vulnerability reporters who follow this policy. If you would like
credit, indicate how you'd like to be acknowledged; otherwise we will list names
or aliases in release notes when appropriate.

## Secure Development and Review Practices

This repository implements automated and procedural controls aligned with SSDF
tasks:

### Code Quality and Security Analysis

- GitHub CodeQL is configured to run automatically on all pull requests and
  pushes to the main branch for static application security testing (SAST).
  CodeQL also runs periodically to detect newly-discovered vulnerabilities in
  existing code.
- CodeQL scan results are reviewed before merges; findings are tracked and
  triaged as security issues.
- Gitleaks secret scanning runs locally pre-commit and automatically on all pull
  requests and pushes to detect accidentally committed credentials and sensitive
  data.
- ❌ (TODO) Deployable branches are protected; proposed merges require review
  from individuals identified in the `CODEOWNERS` file.

### Dependency and Supply-Chain Management

- GitHub Dependabot monitors all declared dependencies and raises pull requests
  for version updates or known vulnerabilities.
- Each Dependabot alert is reviewed and merged promptly after verification of
  compatibility and stability.
- A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is generated for each release and
  published alongside artifacts.

### CI/CD and Build Integrity

- All CI workflows enforce security checks (linting, CodeQL, secret scanning).
  Project-specific test suites and dependency audits should be added based on
  your technology stack.
- GitHub Actions workflows use least-privilege permissions scoped to specific
  jobs.
- ❌ (TODO) Least privilege access is enforced for maintainers; MFA is required.
- ❌ (not implemented) Release artifacts and Git tags are cryptographically
  signed.

### Contributor Security Guidelines

- Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` for pre-commit and pre-merge requirements, tests, and
  code review expectations.
- ❌ (TODO) Never commit credentials, tokens, or API keys. Follow the secrets
  management processes for developer and deployment environments.
- New dependencies require a brief justification and review for licensing and
  security risk.
